# Lab Report 5

## Part 2: Reflection
Prompt: In a couple of sentences, describe something you learned from your lab experience in the second half of this quarter that you didn’t know before. It could be a technical topic we addressed specifically, something cool you found out on your own building on labs, something you learned from a tutor or classmate, and so on. It doesn’t have to be specifically related to a lab writeup, we just want to hear about cool things you learned!\

This lab is actually the first time I ever used Github! I know Github is a huge standard when it comes to programming and I knew a few of my classmates have used it before.
Additionally, similar to how this is the first time I have ever used Github, this class is also the first time that I used VS Code. I actually thought that using these two programs was quite hard at least in my opinion. Before VS Code, I have ever only used Replit for all my coding assignments since high shchool.\

Besides using new programs, something I found fun was being able to create a website using Github pages and building/running a server! I never thought about these things and how they work, but being able to
make it myself was prety nice. This is also the first time I ever used VIM and Bash and I found it confusing, but with practice everything should be fine in the end. Learning how to use markdown is also pretty helpful. I feel like I can apply this to my life all the time as I'm going to be using Github more often!
